    This class implements an Effect that has a simple one-play cycle.
    With this class, you call go( source, target ).  It will clean itself up
    and when completely finished, and its self.going flag will be reset.
    
    maxDuration is an important parameter, it makes sure that OneShots do
    not build up in the world.   In some cases, Effect files cannot work out
    their duration (e.g. if a continuously time-triggered particle effect is
    referenced in the effect.)  In these cases, maxDuration is used to cap the
    time the effect is in use.  If this behaviour is not desired, you should
    use FX.Persistent instead, and manage the lifetime of the effect yourself.
    
    This type of Effect does not keep a permanent assocation with any source.
