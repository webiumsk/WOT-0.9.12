Interface FX.Event

An event defines a single task that is played out on an actor.  It defines
5 methods that must be implemented :

- load
- go
- stop
- duration
- eventTiming

Event Timings

All FX are started over 3 frames, not just 1.

Firstly, immediate events are played.  There is nothing special to say about
these.

Secondly, transform dependent events are played.  These events require exact
knowledge of where the effect is to be played in the world.  Due to the way
nodes are accessed in python, there can be one frame between accessing a node,
and that node having a valid world transform stored in it.  Since many actors
are attached to nodes or hard-points, most events need to wait a single frame
after attachment before they play.  An example is simply spawning a particle.
If the particle system's node is not yet valid, the particles will be spawned
in the wrong spot, e.g. at the world origin.

Finally, duration dependent events are played.  These events need to know the
duration of the entire effect, before they are initiated.  An example would be
a light fade-out event that needs to be timed to finish with the rest of the
effect.
